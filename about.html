  <h3>"Let your attitude be your voice"</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">
     Althea Vidal Rabadon is a 3rd year BS Information Technology student at Ilocos Sur Polytechnic State college. A once
	 dreamer that's still dreaming. Her father died when she was three and her mother needs to work in another city for them
     to have enough support. Since then, she started living at her grandparents house, she literally grew up with her 
     grandparents. Her dream course was Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, but because of financial problems and self-doubt, 
	 she pursued Information Technology. 
	 <br><br>
	 She's not good at everything but she can always try, because someone says, trying is better than doing nothing. She can 
	 go beyond her capabilities and always willing to learn. She doesn't have a good past but she's working really hard to 
	 have a better present and make her future self proud. She survive the days she thought she couldn't, a tough woman who
	 will soon create a name out there for herself.
